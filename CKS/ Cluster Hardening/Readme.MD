## Cluster Hardening Domain (15% Weightage)
The Cluster Hardening domain remains critical in protecting the Kubernetes cluster from potential threats.

- Restricting API Access: This domain emphasizes restricting access to the Kubernetes API to ensure that only authorized users can interact with the cluster.
- RBAC Policies: The use of Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) is encouraged to minimize exposure and ensure that users and services have only the necessary permissions.
- Service Account Management: Managing service accounts carefully is still critical, as they can be a potential attack vector if misconfigured.
- Frequent Kubernetes Updates: Keeping the Kubernetes version up to date is emphasized to avoid vulnerabilities that could be exploited in older versions.
