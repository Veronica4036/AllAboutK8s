# Falco: Cloud-Native Runtime Security

## Introduction

Falco is an open-source, cloud-native runtime security tool designed to detect anomalous activity in applications and containers. It acts as a security camera for your systems, continuously monitoring and alerting on any suspicious behavior.

## What is Falco?

Falco uses system calls to gain deep visibility into container, application, host, and network activity. It comes with a powerful and extensible rules engine to define expected behavior and trigger alerts on violations.

## Key Components

### Rules

Rules are the core of Falco's detection mechanism. They define conditions for alerting on specific events or behaviors.

Example:
```yaml
- rule: Unauthorized Process Execution
  desc: Detect execution of unauthorized processes
  condition: proc.name in (unauthorized_processes)
  output: "Unauthorized process executed (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: WARNING
```

### Lists

Lists are collections of items that can be referenced in rules, making it easier to manage groups of related values.

Example:
```yaml
- list: authorized_users
  items: ["root", "admin", "sysadmin"]

- rule: Unauthorized User Login
  condition: user.name != authorized_users
  output: "Login by unauthorized user (user=%user.name)"
```

### Macros

Macros are reusable snippets of condition logic that can be included in multiple rules.

Example:
```yaml
- macro: is_shell
  condition: proc.name in (shell_binaries)

- rule: Shell Execution in Container
  condition: container and is_shell
  output: "Shell executed in container (user=%user.name container=%container.name)"
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file for Falco is located at `/etc/falco/falco.yaml`. This file contains important settings such as:

- `rules_file`: List of rule files to be loaded (order is important)
- `json_output`: Determines the output format (JSON or text)
- Log settings
- Output channels

Example:
```yaml
rules_file:
  - /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml
  - /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml
  - /etc/falco/k8s_audit_rules.yaml

json_output: false
```

## Working with Rules

### Finding Rules

To search for specific rules:

```bash
grep -ir 'rule description' /etc/falco/
```

### Updating Rules

1. Edit the rule in the appropriate file (e.g., `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`)
2. Hot-reload Falco configuration:
   ```bash
   kill -1 $(cat /var/run/falco.pid)
   ```

Example of updating a rule:

```yaml
- rule: Launch Package Management Process in Container
  desc: Package management process ran inside container
  condition: >
    spawned_process
    and container
    and user.name != "_apt"
    and package_mgmt_procs
    and not package_mgmt_ancestor_procs
    and not user_known_package_manager_in_container
  output: >
    Package Management Tools Executed (user_loginuid=%user.loginuid command=%proc.cmdline container_name=%container.name)
  priority: ERROR
  tags: [process, mitre_persistence]
```

## Best Practices

1. Use specific, well-defined rules to minimize false positives
2. Leverage lists and macros for better organization and maintainability
3. Regularly update and tune rules based on your environment
4. Use version control for your custom rules
5. Test rules thoroughly before deploying to production

## Common Pitfalls

1. Overly broad rules leading to alert fatigue
2. Neglecting to update rules as your environment changes
3. Incorrect rule precedence due to file order in `rules_file`
4. Performance impact from excessive or poorly optimized rules
5. Failing to secure Falco's output to prevent tampering
