# Falco: Runtime Security and Threat Detection

## Introduction

Falco is an open-source, cloud-native runtime security tool designed to detect and alert on anomalous activity in containers, Kubernetes clusters, and cloud applications. It uses a powerful and flexible rules engine to identify suspicious behavior and potential security threats in real-time.

## Key Components

### Rules

Rules are the core of Falco's detection capabilities. They define conditions that, when met, trigger alerts.

Example:
```yaml
- rule: Unauthorized Process Execution
  desc: Detect execution of unauthorized processes
  condition: proc.name in (unauthorized_processes)
  output: "Unauthorized process executed (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: WARNING
```

### Lists

Lists are collections of items that can be referenced in rules, making it easier to manage and update large sets of values.

Example:
```yaml
- list: unauthorized_processes
  items: [nc, ncat, nmap, tcpdump, wireshark]
```

### Macros

Macros are reusable snippets of condition logic that can be referenced in multiple rules.

Example:
```yaml
- macro: is_system_user
  condition: user.uid <= 999

- rule: System User Shell Access
  desc: Detect when a system user gains shell access
  condition: spawned_process and is_system_user
  output: "System user gained shell access (user=%user.name)"
  priority: WARNING
```

## Configuration

Falco's main configuration file is located at `/etc/falco/falco.yaml`. This file contains important settings such as:

- `rules_file`: List of rule files to load (order is important)
- `json_output`: Determines the output format (JSON or text)
- Log settings
- Output channels

Example:
```yaml
rules_file:
  - /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml
  - /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml
  - /etc/falco/k8s_audit_rules.yaml

json_output: false
```

### Output Format

The `json_output` field in the configuration file determines the format of logged events:
- If set to `false`, events are logged in text format
- If set to `true`, events are logged in JSON format

### Rule Precedence

When the same rule is configured in multiple files listed in the `rules_file` section:
- Rules are read in the order of files in the list
- The rule in the last file overrides the others

## Working with Rules

### Finding Rules

To search for specific rules:

```bash
grep -ir 'Package management process launched in container' /etc/falco/
```

### Updating Rules

1. Edit the rule in the appropriate file (e.g., `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`)
2. Hot-reload Falco configuration:
   ```bash
   kill -1 $(cat /var/run/falco.pid)
   ```

Example of updating a rule:

```yaml
- rule: Launch Package Management Process in Container
  desc: Package management process ran inside container
  condition: >
    spawned_process
    and container
    and user.name != "_apt"
    and package_mgmt_procs
    and not package_mgmt_ancestor_procs
    and not user_known_package_manager_in_container
  output: >
    Package Management Tools Executed (user_loginuid=%user.loginuid command=%proc.cmdline container_name=%container.name)
  priority: ERROR
  tags: [process, mitre_persistence]
```

### Identifying Rule Names from Output

To find the name of a rule that triggered a specific output:

1. Inspect the output logged for the event
2. Search for the output string in the Falco rules files

Example:
```bash
grep -ir 'Package management process launched in container' /etc/falco/
```

This command might return results like:
```
/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml:    Package management process launched in container (user=%user.name user_loginuid=%user.loginuid command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid container_id=%container.id container_name=%container.name image=%container.image namespace=%k8s.ns.name)
/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml:    Package management process launched in container (user=%user.name user_loginuid=%user.loginuid
```

3. Open the relevant file (e.g., `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`) and locate the rule

Example rule:
```yaml
- rule: Launch Package Management Process in Container
  desc: Package management process ran inside container
  condition: >
    spawned_process
    and container
    and user.name != "_apt"
    and package_mgmt_procs
    and not package_mgmt_ancestor_procs
    and not user_known_package_manager_in_container
  output: >
    Package management process launched in container (user=%user.name user_loginuid=%user.loginuid command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid container_id=%container.id container_name=%container.name image=%container.image namespace=%k8s.ns.name)
  priority: ERROR
  tags: [process, mitre_persistence]
```

Alternatively, you can use this command to search and display the context:
```bash
grep -ni "Package management process launched in container" /etc/falco/* -C 15
```

## Best Practices

1. Use lists and macros to keep rules DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
2. Prioritize rules based on their severity and potential impact
3. Regularly review and update rules to adapt to new threats
4. Use version control for your custom rules
5. Test rules thoroughly before deploying to production

## Common Pitfalls

1. Overloading the system with too many complex rules
2. Neglecting to update rules, leading to outdated detection capabilities
3. Creating overly broad rules that generate excessive false positives
4. Failing to properly scope rules, resulting in unintended matches
5. Ignoring the order of rule files, which can lead to unexpected behavior
