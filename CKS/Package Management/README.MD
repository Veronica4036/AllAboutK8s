# Linux Package Management Guide

## Important Files

1. `/etc/apt/sources.list`: Contains repository URLs for apt
2. `/var/lib/dpkg/status`: Database of installed packages (Debian/Ubuntu)
3. `/etc/yum.repos.d/`: Directory containing repository files for yum (CentOS/RHEL)

## Useful Commands

### APT (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
apt update                    # Update package lists
apt upgrade                   # Upgrade all upgradable packages
apt install package_name      # Install a package
apt remove package_name       # Remove a package
apt purge package_name        # Remove package and its configuration files
apt list --installed          # List installed packages
apt search keyword            # Search for packages
```

### YUM (CentOS/RHEL)
```bash
yum update                    # Update all packages
yum install package_name      # Install a package
yum remove package_name       # Remove a package
yum list installed            # List installed packages
yum search keyword            # Search for packages
```

### System Services
```bash
systemctl list-units --type service        # List all active services
systemctl list-units --all                 # List all units, active and inactive
systemctl list-units --state inactive      # List inactive units
systemctl start service_name               # Start a service
systemctl stop service_name                # Stop a service
systemctl restart service_name             # Restart a service
systemctl status service_name              # Check status of a service
```

### Kernel Modules
```bash
lsmod                         # List loaded kernel modules
modprobe module_name          # Load a kernel module
modprobe -r module_name       # Unload a kernel module
```

## Key Pointers

1. Always update package lists before installing or upgrading packages.
2. Use `apt full-upgrade` or `yum upgrade` cautiously as they might remove packages.
3. Regularly update your system to patch security vulnerabilities.
4. Be careful when removing packages, as it might affect dependent services.
5. Use `apt-mark hold package_name` to prevent a package from being automatically updated.

## Common Tasks

### Updating a Specific Package
```bash
apt install --only-upgrade package_name
```

### Removing a Service
```bash
systemctl stop service_name
systemctl disable service_name
rm /lib/systemd/system/service_name.service
systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Blacklisting a Kernel Module
Edit `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`:
```
blacklist module_name
```

### Finding and Stopping a Service on a Specific Port
```bash
netstat -natp | grep port_number
systemctl stop service_name
```

### Checking for and Installing Package Updates
```bash
apt update
apt list --upgradable
apt install package_name -y
```

Remember to always check the impact of package changes, especially on production systems. It's a good practice to test updates on a non-production environment first.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of package management in Linux, focusing on both APT (for Debian-based systems) and YUM (for Red Hat-based systems). It includes common commands, important files, key pointers, and step-by-step instructions for common tasks related to package and service management.
