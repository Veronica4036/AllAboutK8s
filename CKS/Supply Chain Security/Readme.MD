## Supply Chain Security (20% Weightage)

The Supply Chain Security domain remains critical with a consistent weightage of 20%. Several updates have been made to incorporate modern tools and methodologies.

- Kubernetes supply chain security
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): A significant addition is the focus on understanding the software bill of materials (SBOM). An SBOM is a detailed list of all components within a software product, helping in identifying vulnerabilities in third-party components.
- Kubesec and KubeLinter: Tools like Kubesec and KubeLinter have been introduced to enhance the security of Kubernetes configurations. Kubesec evaluates resource configurations for best practices, while KubeLinter analyzes YAML files and Helm charts for potential security risks.
- CI/CD Security: Securing the CI/CD pipeline is emphasized, ensuring that software builds and deployments are secure from vulnerabilities.
