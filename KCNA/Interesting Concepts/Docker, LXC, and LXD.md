## Differences between Docker, LXC, and LXD containers:

1. LXC (Linux Containers)
```
OS Level
+------------------+
|  Your App        |
|  Full OS Stack   | <- Includes init system, multiple processes
|  Networking      |
+------------------+
|  Shared Kernel   |
+------------------+
```
- System containers (like lightweight VMs)
- Can run multiple processes
- Has init system
- Better for running full operating systems
- Direct use of Linux kernel features
- More isolated networking

2. Docker
```
Application Level
+------------------+
|  Your App        | <- Usually single process
|  Minimal OS      | <- Just what app needs
|  Libraries       |
+------------------+
|  Shared Kernel   |
+------------------+
```
- Application containers
- Designed for microservices
- Usually runs single process
- Immutable images
- Rich ecosystem of tools
- Easy to share via Docker Hub
- Focuses on portability

3. LXD
```
Management Layer
+------------------+
|     LXD          | <- Management layer
+------------------+
|     LXC          | <- Uses LXC under the hood
+------------------+
|  System Container|
+------------------+
|  Shared Kernel   |
+------------------+
```
- Built on top of LXC
- Provides better user experience
- REST API
- Better image management
- Better security features
- Cross-host management
- Easier networking setup

Key Differences Table:
```
Feature          | Docker           | LXC              | LXD
-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------
Purpose          | Applications     | System          | System
Process Model    | Single process   | Multi-process   | Multi-process
Init System      | No              | Yes             | Yes
Image Format     | Docker images    | Templates       | Images/Templates
Management       | Docker CLI       | LXC tools       | LXD CLI/API
Portability      | Very High       | Medium          | High
Security         | Good            | Better          | Best
Use Case         | Microservices   | VM alternative  | VM alternative
Learning Curve   | Low             | High            | Medium
```

Common Use Cases:
1. Docker
   - Microservices
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Application deployment
   - Development environments

2. LXC
   - Testing environments
   - Development environments
   - System containers
   - Legacy applications

3. LXD
   - Development environments
   - Production workloads
   - Cloud infrastructure
   - Server consolidation

Example Commands Comparison:
```bash
# Docker
docker run nginx

# LXC
lxc-create -n container1 -t ubuntu
lxc-start -n container1

# LXD
lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 container1
```

The choice between them depends on your needs:
- Use Docker for application containers and microservices
- Use LXC/LXD for system containers or when you need full OS functionality
- Use LXD when you want better management features over LXC
